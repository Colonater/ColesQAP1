You are allowed to complete the assessment problems below 
in whatever way you can but please answer the following
 questions/points as part of your submission:

1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 
(Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each
individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine;
we just want a rough idea.)

I'd say i spend about 2 hours of Rescearching the Node Modules
before i could write any code and a spend roughly 1 hour 
writing and throubleshooting the code

2. What online resources you have used?
 (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

i payed attention to your lectures, and the links you send in the teams.
i found some great youtube videos on the pakages and how they work and i had to use
stack overflow to debug my cookie.js 

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems.
 (If yes, please mention name of the friend.
  They must be amongst your class fellows.)

Johney from dominion reminded me about the .gitignore file and help me with it

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, 
how many questions did you ask 
(or how many help sessions did you require)?

No was fairly straight forward.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective,
 and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different 
 problem requiring some of the same techniques 
in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

5/10 was fine after i did the required rescearch and yes i'd feel fairly 
confindent using these modules in my future code
